Trained 2 models - Linear regression model and random forest regression.
Random forest model performed better with a ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR: 458218.10866324935 while linear regression model had a ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR: 381755.3580712063.
Random forest regression performed better and so we adopted it.
This work is open to further improvement by group members
